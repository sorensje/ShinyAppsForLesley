# ShinyAppsForLesley
budget and calculator apps made for lesley for xmas 2013

basic_calc:
- simple app that lets the user calculate the cost of some type of product based on the unit cost (original intention: total cost of fabric given price per yard)
- to run locally: runApp("basic\_calc")

graph_budget:
- slightly more complex app that lets user specify costs and visualize them flexibly as a bar graph
* visualization allows user to see how much of their budget each item takes up
* allows them to see when they are over budget
- user can specify costs, total budget
